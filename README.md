  I am new to the developer and GitHub community. I am currently in a coding cohort through MIT 
  and though this world is new, strange and confusing, 
  I'm hoping to eventually make a new career of it.
  
  ## Updates
  It's exciting to be a part of this community. I look forward to learning as I journey through the 
  course and I will update my profile as I gain knowledge and skills.
